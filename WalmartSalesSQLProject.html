										<p>Walmart Sales SQL Project</p>
							
							<p><h4 style="color:black">Business Task and Overview:</h4>
                            The primary task was to create an efficient system for exploring and analyzing retail sales data to support decision-making. This involved setting up a reliable database, cleaning the data for accuracy, and using SQL to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA). The goal was to answer key business questions related to sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance, which provided valuable insights that could guide strategic planning and optimize retail operations.</p>
                            <h4 style="color:black">Insights and Recommendations:</h4>
                            <ol>
                                <li style="color:black">Electric Accessories Drive Sales Volume:</li> The "Electroic Accessories" product line is the highest-selling category with 971 units sold, indicating strong customer demand. This product line could be prioritized for promotions or stock optimization to maximize revenue.
                                <br><lu style="color: black">Recomendation:</lu> Consider focusing marketing campaigns and bundling deals around electronic accessories  to boost sales further.
                                <li style="color:black">January's High Cost and Revenue:</li> January not only had the highest revenue ($116,291.86) but also the largest COGS ($110,754.16). This suggests that while the month was profitable, operating costs were substaintial, potentially due to holiday promotions or increased seasonal demand.
                                <br><lu style="color: black">Recommendation:</lu> Review cost management strategies and supplier contracts to reduce COGS and increase profitability during peak months. 
                                <li style="color:black">Members Contribute More Revenue:</li> Members generated a total revenue of $164,223.44, which is higher than the $158,743.30 contributed by normal customers. This hightlights the importance of loyalty programs and memeber-exclusive benefits in driving revenue. 
                                <br><lu style="color: black">Recomendation:</lu> Enhance member benefits and implement targeted loyalty promotions to encourage more customers to join the membership program.
                                <li style="color:black">Evening Purchases Yield Higher Ratings:</li> All branches received higher than average customer ratings during the evening hours, with Branch C having the highest average at 7.07/10. This could indicate a more relaxed shopping experience or better service availability during these hours. 
                                <br><lu style="color: black">Recomendation:</lu> Optimize staffing and customer service during evening hours to maintain or improve customer satisfaction levels.
                                <li style="color:black">City-Specific Focus</li> Naypyitaw recorded the highest total revenue ($110,568.70), suggesting a strong customer base or high purchase frequency in this region. 
                                <br><lu style="color: black">Recomendation:</lu> Allocate resources for more targeted marketing and inventory management in Naypyitaw to sustain and further grow this revenue stream.
